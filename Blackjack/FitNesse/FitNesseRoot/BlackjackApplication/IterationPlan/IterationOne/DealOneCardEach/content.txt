We will deal one card to the player and one to the dealer.
From these we will determine whether the PlayerWinsOrLoses.

Acceptance Criteria
 * The player is dealt first, then dealer.
 * The cards are dealt from the 'shoe', which we will set up first (no randomness)
 * Dealt cards are removed from the shoe, undealt cards remain.

For example:

If the cards in the shoe are A, 2, 3, 4
Then player gets the Ace, Dealer gets the 2. Still in the shoe are 3 and 4.
